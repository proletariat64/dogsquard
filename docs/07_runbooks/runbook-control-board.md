# Control Board Runbook

## Purpose

Issue #1 is the one-screen project controller for Dogsquard.

It should let the user and agents understand the full project picture quickly without turning into a historical changelog.

Detailed roadmap, history, and phase grouping live in:

```text
docs/05_design/design-20260531-project-roadmap.md
```

## Correct Control Board Shape

Issue #1 should include:

- Current Milestone
- Current Objective
- Dashboard capability table
- Now / Next / Later
- Current Decisions
- Open Questions
- Guardrails
- Latest Completed
- Next Deliverable
- Links to detailed docs

The Control Board should be compact enough to read quickly and complete enough to show where the project stands.

## Checklist And Status Style

Issue #1 should use checkbox and todo-list formatting.

Use these status indicators:

- 🟢 Done, healthy, or low risk
- 🟡 Active, pending, or needing attention
- 🔴 Blocked, risky, or not to touch without explicit approval

The overall project picture should stay high level. Only the next two or three deliverables should be broken down into actionable checklist detail.

## Balance

Too much:

- full historical checklist
- every PR detail
- every command
- every validation line

Too little:

- only current focus
- only next deliverable
- no capability map
- no later milestones
- no open questions

Correct:

- one-screen full-picture dashboard
- checkbox and todo-list style
- green, yellow, and red status indicators
- high-level capability map
- actionable detail for only the next two or three deliverables
- roadmap docs for detail

## When To Update Issue #1

Update Issue #1:

- after merging a deliverable PR
- when current milestone changes
- when a key decision changes
- when an open question is answered
- when guardrails change

## When Not To Update Issue #1

Do not update Issue #1:

- after every command
- for every tiny validation
- for raw logs
- for full PR history

## PR Granularity Rules

### Good PR Size

A good PR represents:

- one deliverable capability
- one workflow-level improvement
- one coherent doc or design package
- one bounded implementation plus tests and docs

Examples:

- "Validate SSH tunnel dev access and document result"
- "Finalize template bootstrap runbook"
- "Add release v0.1.0 checklist"
- "Harden one workflow with tests and docs"

### Too Small

Avoid PRs for:

- one SSH command check
- one tunnel check
- one comment update
- one validation line
- one typo unless urgent

Examples:

- "Run one SSH tunnel command"
- "Confirm one curl response"
- "Add one checkbox to Issue #1"
- "Fix one sentence in roadmap docs"

### Too Large

Avoid combining unrelated high-risk surfaces, such as:

- deployment, production, public routing, and Docker in one PR
- backend feature, CI workflow, and server config in one PR
- product behavior change and infrastructure rollout in one PR

Examples:

- "Add public routing, Docker, production deploy, and branch protection"
- "Change backend behavior, deploy workflow, and server proxy at once"
- "Introduce auth, database, and production release together"

### Rule

A PR should be reviewable in one sitting and leave the repo in a coherent state.

## Agent Instructions

Agents should:

- read Issue #1 first, then roadmap docs
- treat Issue #1 as the current controller
- use roadmap docs for detailed history
- avoid inventing product direction
- avoid command-sized micro-phase PRs
- keep Issue #1 readable
- update relevant docs when process or roadmap meaning changes

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:

- endless micro-phases
- one command per PR
- using Issue #1 as a full changelog
- shrinking Issue #1 until the user loses the project picture
- hiding decisions inside chat only
- shipping technical behavior without updating relevant docs
